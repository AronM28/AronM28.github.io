Hi there, my name is Aron and this is my page.

So I work in IT and I'm attempting to run some blogs while learning all things coding.  Safe to say it's going poorly.

There's this blog, which will probably just be some ramblings and updates to general progress and updates for elsewhere.  And then we have my two other blogs;

* [Passively Simple](http://www.passivelysimple.com "Investing blog") - This is my simple blog about simple investing.
* [Till Dawn Audio](http://www.tilldawnaudio.com "Music blog") - This is my music blog, basically a place to collate music that I enjoy.

I hope you enjoy this page and my other sites.  

Thanks for visiting.
